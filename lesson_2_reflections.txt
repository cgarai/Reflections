git init   // configures initial ,git repository without any commits

git add	 filename  // stages files to be commited

The Staging area allows one to look at all the files that are going to be commited
from the working directory.

     Working Directory  >> Contains all the files in the current workspace
     Staging Area	>> Contains files in the workspace that will be commited

git diff   // Compares working directory with Staging area.  If Staging area
    	   been commited, then compares working dir with commit.  This is
	   because after a commit the Staging Area and Commit are the same

git diff --staged // Compares Staging Area with commit

git show commit   // shows diff from commit and it's parent.

git reset --hard  // removes all changes in working directory.

Staging area can be used to compare proposed changes with existing.
This will help in making one logical change per commit.

Branching:

git branch //  will list branches and indicate current branch

git branch B-Name   // creates the new branch B-Name

Any commits made to a branch below the TIP (last commit of a branch) are isolated from the branch.  A new branch can be made using

git branch new-branch-name

git checkout -b new-branch-name // this will create the new branch and check it out


Merging:

git merge branch1 branch2   // If branch1 is ommited current branch is merged

if merge fails, either

git merge --abort

or fix and then commit.  Commit will finish the merge
