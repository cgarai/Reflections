git init   // configures initial ,git repository without any commits

git add	 filename  // stages files to be commited

The Staging area allows one to look at all the files that are going to be commited
from the working directory.

     Working Directory  >> Contains all the files in the current workspace
     Staging Area	>> Contains files in the workspace that will be commited

git diff   // Compares working directory with Staging area.  If Staging area
    	   been commited, then compares working dir with commit.  This is
	   because after a commit the Staging Area and Commit are the same

git diff --staged // Compares Staging Area with commit

git reset --hard  // removes all changes in working directory.
