This is  afile with reflections on using Git


git commands learned:

git clone url    ... get the repository
git log          ... List the change history
git diff commit1 commit2  ... diff two commits
git checkout     ...      Revert to the checked out commit




So far we have touched on  fc  and diff

I used  diff.  I'm not sure how many lines it decides to display around differences

-u NUM shows NUM lines before and after differences.  NUM = 3 default

Multi file commits

So you can track how all files change between commits

git diff and git log (stat)

I can search the git log using /????  to find ????
Use u and d to move up and down a half screen

git diff allows comparison of commit numbers.  In git bash select and right click
to copy and then right-click to paste



Git checkout commit#  immediately reverts the files in the working directory
to the files that are in that commit.
