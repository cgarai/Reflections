When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

For sharing with others or with ones self on different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want your work to have changes that are pushed from others until you
are ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork:  is a copy of a repository from another GitHub user made on one's own GH
account.  It allows one to make changes to a project that will not affect the original.

Clone: Is a local copy of a repository.

Branch: Is a change to a node on a repository


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

So you can see changes that have been made since you last fetched

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Sharing files back and forth, perhaps with a cloud.  Conceptually it is easier, but
    it doesn't make tracking easier.  Git is a bit difficult to master some of the concepts,
    but I think it will be worth it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  Making changes to the master only makes sense if no one else is working on the
  project. Branches allow one to make and test changes independent of what others
  are doing.  Once completed one can merge back into the master branch, which may not
  look the same as it once did.
